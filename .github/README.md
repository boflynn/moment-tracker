# Moment Tracker

This is a simple one-page app (not Single Page Application) for keeping a countdown
available for upcoming events (or countup from past events). Given the simplicity
of the code and that, unless I chose to way over-engineer it, there wasn't much
to learn from making this, I'll jump on the LLM train.

This was written purely using Google Gemini, with 2.5 Flash. Each prompt and the
corresponding code are committed independently.
